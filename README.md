# EarthMap3D

A so called topological compass in 3D.

Based on height-maps of current location this app creates a topological 3d-view, which can be combined with compass, tracker and much more.

This app also offers a modern screen design, so all needed information can be got "just by drive". 

Perfect suitable for bicyclists, bikers, drivers, hikers, walkers or everyone who want need to use it.

(NOTE: Project is on ice this time due to technical problems with terrain data server. 
NASA switched off one satelite, so terrain data server cannot generate data files as usual.)
